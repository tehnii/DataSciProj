# Food Dataset Analysis

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence), where we analyse a food dataset. 
Please view the source code in order from:

1. EDA
2. KMeans Clustering
3. Hierachical Clustering

## Problem Definition

- Are we able to use clustering to categorise food based on their macronutrients, and use it to make wiser decisions in the food we consume?
- Which clustering model would be the best for it?

## Models Used

1. K-Means
2. Hierachical Clustering

## Conclusion

- K-Means is the best model for large datasets like this dataset. It is able to cluster food distinctively based on their macronutrients.
- Hierachical Clustering has very high time complexity for large datasets. The cluster results have many discrepancies with many different types of food being      clustered together, hence unable to find similarity. 
- Yes, it is possible to categorise food based on their macronutrients, but only to a certain extent. This is due to the numerous types of food present, and categorising food depends on many other factors, such as its origin and its state.

## What did we learn from this project?
